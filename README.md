# arti-connect
A web app just like Fiverr. Built in:
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, EJS (Frontend)
- Nodejs, Express, Mongoose and MongoDB (Backend)
This is an MVP (Minimun Viable Product). It currently shows details of artisans with no in-app communication between users and artisans.
Users can sign up, artisans / freelancers can also sign up on artiConnect.
This is a personal project of mine and in future, I wish to make certain changes and updates to this project.
Some of which are:
<ol>
  <li>In-app communication between users and freelancers / agencies.</li>
  <li>Change the front end to React instead of ejs which it is currently built in.</li>
  <li>Create a REST API to allow 2.</li>
  <li>Authentication and authorization using JWT</li>
  <li>Uploading, storing and retrieving images through a Content Delivery Network(CDN), most preferrably, Cloudinary.</li>
  <li>Would most likeky make a lot of changes to the UI and animations</li>
</ol>
